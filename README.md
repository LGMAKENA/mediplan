## Problem and Solution

The current healthcare system faces challenges related to appointment management. Patients often struggle to schedule, track, and manage their appointments, while doctors find it challenging to organize their patient schedules effectively. Moreover, the lack of a digital platform hinders proper record-keeping and communication between patients and doctors.

- Authentication for doctors' login.

### Appointment Creation and Management

- Patients can create, view, and delete their appointments.
- Doctors can create, view, and update appointments associated with their patients.

### Dashboard and Landing Page

- A simple landing page accessible to both doctors and patients.
- A dashboard for doctors to efficiently manage their appointments.

### Appointment Listing

- Display a list of appointments for each user, with patients seeing their appointments and doctors seeing appointments associated with their patients.

### User Roles

- Implementation of two user roles: Patients and Doctors.

### Backend-Backend Integration

- Basic backend functionality for user authentication, appointment creation, and retrieval.

### Security

- Implementation of basic security measures to protect user data and authentication.

### Frontend-Backend Integration
